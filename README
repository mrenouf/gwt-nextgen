gwt-nextgen is an attempt to expose all recent and emerging features being provided in current versions of web browsers. 

The functionality is grouped into Modules within a specific API or area of functionality:

Canvas
Media
Geolocation
HTML5 input elements
WebSocket
WebStorage

Many of these APIs do not yet work on a majority of web browsers. The goal of this library is to expose the native functionality to allow GWT developers to prototype the next generation of applications quickly using recently available APIs. No emulation modes or fallback mechanisms are present however, where possible feature detection is provided.
